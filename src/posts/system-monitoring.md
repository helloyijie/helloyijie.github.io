# System Monitoring Best Practices

Effective system monitoring is crucial for maintaining healthy and performant systems. This guide covers essential monitoring techniques and tools.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### System Resources

- **CPU Usage**: Monitor CPU utilization and load averages
- **Memory Usage**: Track RAM consumption and swap usage
- **Disk I/O**: Monitor disk read/write operations and space usage
- **Network**: Track bandwidth usage and connection counts

### Application Metrics

- **Response Time**: Monitor application response times
- **Error Rates**: Track application errors and exceptions
- **Throughput**: Monitor requests per second
- **Database Performance**: Query execution times and connection pools

## Essential Monitoring Tools

### Command Line Tools

```bash
# System resource monitoring
top
htop
iotop
netstat

# Disk usage
df -h
du -sh *

# Memory usage
free -h
vmstat

# Network monitoring
ss -tuln
iftop
```

### Monitoring Solutions

1. **Prometheus + Grafana**
   - Time-series database with powerful visualization
   - Excellent for metrics collection and alerting

2. **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**
   - Centralized logging and log analysis
   - Great for troubleshooting and forensics

3. **Nagios**
   - Traditional monitoring solution
   - Good for infrastructure monitoring

## Setting Up Alerts

### Critical Thresholds

- CPU usage > 80% for 5 minutes
- Memory usage > 90%
- Disk space > 85%
- Application response time > 2 seconds

### Alert Channels

- Email notifications
- Slack/Teams integration
- SMS for critical alerts
- PagerDuty for on-call rotation

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic system metrics
2. **Avoid Alert Fatigue**: Set meaningful thresholds
3. **Document Everything**: Maintain runbooks for common issues
4. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and adjust monitoring
5. **Automate Responses**: Use automation for common remediation tasks

## Conclusion

Effective monitoring is an ongoing process that requires careful planning and regular maintenance. Start with the basics and gradually expand your monitoring coverage as your systems grow.
